Diffie-Hellman is widely used in secure communication protocols such as TLS (used in HTTPS) and in secure messaging apps like Signal. It allows two parties to derive a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared key can then be used for encryption. DH is important because it ensures forward secrecy, meaning that even if the long-term private key is compromised, past communications remain secure.
